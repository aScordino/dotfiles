## Infos
### Information about PiP
Picutre in Picture, introduced in [`0b61c7b`](https://github.com/aScordino/dotfiles/commit/0b61c7b2722d1599769a3ebfbab97a77e488b269), is really hard to actually implement and adjust.

First of all, _Chromium_ and _Firefox_ have two differents PiP name, Chromium uses "Picture in picture" while Firefox uses "Picture in Picture". So, be careful.

Also, if you want to resize the Picture in Picutre, you'd have to move the position and all directly from **the configuration files**.

I don't know why, since it works flawlessly on i3wm. But heh, whatever. I'll try to find a better solution to this mess.
